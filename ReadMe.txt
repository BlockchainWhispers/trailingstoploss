Step 1) Download NodeJs Windows/macOS Installer from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

	the TrailingStopLoss application

Windows:

a) installWindows.bat
b) startWindows.bat

Step 3) Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser of choice and login with your Binance API KEYS

IMPORTANT

a) After installing the app, please note that your start file will open the server.
If you close your computer this application will stop. Each time you reopen 
your computer, you will have to run the start file again.

b) We recommend cancelling orders through the Trailing Stop Loss app, even though you can cancel from Binance
too, there is a chance you might catch the order in an intermediate state (price shift) and the cancel from
Binance won't work.

c) You can only use one order per trading pair on each coin.

d) If the balance is not displayed correctly please use the Update Balance button.
